✧ :: Do not refer to me as "good girl/boy" or "mommy/daddy". I believe it is obvious as to why.

♢ :: DNI: the general criteria, pro-ai, anti-furry/anti-therian. (more things are to be added)

✧ :: IWC: swocket,medhammer,subkit,vinespace, or coilspace shippers.

♢ :: not really a dni or a boundary but if you have something like "(insert fandom here) DNI" your opinion does not matter that much to me sorry not sorry,, if you have a fandom trigger or something like that then this doesn't apply to you.
