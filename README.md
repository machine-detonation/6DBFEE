[^1]: I DO hide/block freely so my DNIs are literally just a synonym for "people that I don't like and/or get blocked on sight)

## Do Not Interact/Interact With Caution

‚ô¢ :: DNI: [the general criteria](https://basic-dni.crd.co/) | pro-ai | anti-furry/anti-therian | 20+ (w/ exceptions) | supporters/fans of BudsForBuddies, Analbones, Meowbahh, Wilbur Soot, The Coffin of Andrew and Leyley | ...

‚úß :: IWC: medhammer, subkit, vinespace, or coilspace shippers | Fujoshis, fundanshis, himejoshis, etc. | ...

## Boundaries

‚ô¢ :: Do not refer to me as "good girl/boy" or "mommy/daddy". I believe it is obvious as to why.

‚úß :: please avoid talking about kinky stuff/fetishes or rape around me unless if I mention it first (or if you are venting).

### extra stuff

‚ô¢ :: piss off if you think I am annoying/problematic for liking something with a weird fandom (I.E, homestuck, dandy's world or pokemon), do NOT rope me in w/ those freaks üôèüôè
