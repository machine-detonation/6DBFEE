## Do Not Interact

♢ :: [the general criteria](https://basic-dni.crd.co/)

:: Pro-AI / AI "Artists"

:: if you joke about P. Diddy. (or any rapists/pedophiles for that matter)

:: Babyfurs/Diaperfurs..

:: DDLG (Daddy Dom Little Girl)

:: weird fans of ANY and ALL fandoms

:: if you use twitter regularly /hj

:: members of the forsaken "Spawnism" cult.. please stay away from me ***I REALLY don't like you guys***

:: If you age up characters just to sexualize them,, why you shouldn't do this is like common sense i fear

:: supporters of anything listed above

### Thin Ice

:: 17+ (VERY THIN ICE.)

:: fans of helluva boss / hazbin hotel (VERY thin ice.)

:: Swocket (Sword x Rocket) shippers. I genuinely hate the ship + I've had way too many bad encounters with people who ship this (I got harassed like 10 fucking times I'm not lying)

:: Subkit, Medhammer or Boomskate shippers. (same reasons as the previous one)

:: SFOTH x anyone (including the NPCs) or just Deity/Immortal x Mortal shippers in general

: any ships with a large age gap (10+ years) in general are on thin ice I don't care if they're both legal adults it's still weird

## Boundaries

♢ :: Do not refer to me as "good girl/boy" or "mommy/daddy". I believe it is obvious as to why.

✧ :: please avoid talking about kinky stuff/fetishes or rape around me unless if I mention it first (or if you are venting).

♢ :: crowd discomfort + don't fully cover me unless ur a friend of mines or I choose to hide behind you

## Interact!!!

✧ :: If you share ANY my [interests](https://github.com/machine-detonation/EDD3A0), especially phighting

♢ :: silly people

✧ :: basically just int if u aren't in my dni gng is that too much to ask
