## Do Not Interact

♢ :: [the general criteria](https://basic-dni.crd.co/)

:: Pro-AI / AI "Artists"

:: 20 years old or older (unless you're a friend of my friends or I interact first)

:: if you joke about P. Diddy. (or any rapists/pedophiles for that matter)

:: Babyfurs/Diaperfurs..

:: DDLG (Daddy Dom Little Girl)

:: weird fans of ANY and ALL fandoms

:: if you use twitter regularly /hj

:: members of the forsaken "Spawnism" cult.. please stay away from me I REALLY don't like you guys

### Thin Ice

:: 17-19 year olds

:: fans of helluva boss / hazbin hotel (VERY thin ice.)

:: Swocket (Sword x Rocket) shippers. I genuinely hate the ship + I've had way too many bad encounters with people who ship this (I got harassed like 10 fucking times I'm not lying)

:: Subkit, Medhammer or Boomskate shippers. (same reasons as the previous one)

## Boundaries

♢ :: Do not refer to me as "good girl/boy" or "mommy/daddy". I believe it is obvious as to why.

✧ :: please avoid talking about kinky stuff/fetishes or rape around me unless if I mention it first (or if you are venting).

♢ :: I'll add more later

## Interact!!!

✧ :: If you share ANY my [interests](https://github.com/machine-detonation/EDD3A0), especially phighting

♢ :: silly people

✧ :: basically just int if u aren't in my dni gng
